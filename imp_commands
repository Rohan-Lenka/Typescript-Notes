HOW TO START A TYPESCRIPT PROJECT 

1) Using CLI ->
> npm i --save-dev typescript -> npx tsc --init (tsconfig.json file gets created) -> create ur ts file and code 
> to compile ts code => npx tsc script.ts (script.js gets created which is basically ur ts code converted to js)
> BUT if ur ts code has error and u still use npx tsc script.ts, the errored ts code will still get converted to js 
& u get a error containing js file
> SOLUTION -> use npx tsc script.ts --noEmitOnError, to prevent errored ts code to get converted to js code  

2) Using a bundler(Vite) -> 
> npm create@latest -> vanilla -> typescript -> cd <project-name> -> npm i -> npm run dev
> i) npm run build -> transpiles ur code into js in this dir only so that u can view the js code as well 
  ii) npm run preview -> u can preview ur transpiled js code in production

> NOTE -> Without the tsconfig.json file, ur ts code will not show type errors9
